        <p>Xenoblade Chronicles is an amzing game that is an awesome combination of great combat, an engaging story, distractingly fun sidequests, and one of the biggest and best worlds gaming has ever seen. It is a game that will pull you in from start to finsish, and there are so many aspects of the game. So, being an RPG, the place we will start today will be the story.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Story</h3>
        <p>The story begins as we tour the creation of the world(s), the Bionis and Mechonis, the two great titans, and their following battle. They eventually stop to rest, and they lay dormant for thousands of years. Life begins to spawn from the titans' bodies, and for many years, the two titans' worlds live in peace. However, the character arcs begin at the Battle of Sword Valley, a major feud between the Homs, the residents of the Bionis, and the Mechon, the life of the Mechonis. </p>
        
        <p>The events of the story beign in the burning sword valley, where a Homs hero, Dunban, and his friends, Mumkhar and Dickson, make a last stand against the mechon with the Monado, a legendary sword said to have been wielded by the Bionis itself. They drive off the mechon, Mumkhar is captured, and Dunban loses the use of his right arm due to overusing the Monado. Fast-forward a few years later, and we meet Shulk, a weapons developer and main protagonist of the game. The beginning of the story takes place in Colony 9, one of the last Homs towns left on the Bionis. We are also introduced to Fiora and Reyn, two of Shulk's best friends.</p>
        
        <p>A few minutes into the story, Colony 9 is attacked by the Mechon. Shulk, Fiora, and Reyn attempt to defend the colony, and Dunban attempts to wield the Monado again to fend off the Mechon, but he fails. Then Shulk picks up the Monado and wields it, to the surprise of everyone, because the Monado can only be wielded by people who are very strong willed and powerful. With the Monado, Shulk begins to see visions of the future, and he uses them to save his friends in battle. However, Fiora is suddenly killed by a strange faced Mechon, and the Mechon escape. Shulk and Reyn vow to exact revenge on the Mechon.</p>
        
        <p>This story begins pretty simple as far as plots go. However, as the story goes on, the story goes through lots of twists and turns, and by the end, the characters are very well developed. What I just wrote about was a small, undetailed snippet of the very beginning of the game. By the end of the game, all of the playable characters are very well developed and fit into the story well, and they all have very distinct and relatable personalities. Also, there are some brilliant twists engineered into the narrative, and overall the story is pretty well written. However, this game shines even more in...</p>

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <div class="bodytype-left">
            <p>The gameplay is pretty detailed and hard to understand at first, but after the beginning of the game, you should understand it better. The combat is not turn-based, as many RPGs are, but it is about real-time movement and using your arts. Every character has different arts and abilities. When you begin a battle, your character will attack the enemy on his or her own, which are called autoattacks. The will constantly hit the enemy for damage based either on physical damage, which most characters use, or ether damage, which will always hit the opponent. When you open up the battle interface upon contact wit an enemy, you will see lots of small circles that, when you select them, will make your character do an action. These are called Arts, and they are core to how characters do in battle. Some inflict debuffs on the enemies, some will do damage based on positioning, and some will heal and apply buffs to your comrades. After a while of battling, you will fill up a small orb in the middle of your Art interface called your Talent Art. This will do something different for each character. Shulk, for example, has the talent art Activate Monado, so he can use the Monado to do different things, like shield his teammates or deal a ton of damage to the enemy. There is a lot more to the combat system than what I just mentioned, but I will leave it there to leave you to discover the rest of the combat mechanics. </p>
            <p>Outside of battle there is still lots to do. The worlds of Bionis and Mechonis are absolutely massive, and you can explore almost all of what you see. The towns and cities you explore are full to the brim with content, and the locales all contribute to the world building and even your adventure in the form of stores. The towns are also full of sidequests that actually are very fun distraction if you don't want to focus on the main story. One of the greatest aspects of Xenoblade is that there is always something to do. You can advance the story, and if you don't want to do that, you can do some sidequests, and if you don't want to do that, you can go fight that huge moster you saw while you were travelling, and the list goes on. It is truly a game you can not put down after you pick it up.</p>
            <h3>Visuals</h3>
            <p>The presentation of Xenoblade Chronicles is a strange mix for me. The game does have dated-looking visuals, despite being released in 2010. This is a trade-off for how huge the game is, so most of the time it isn't really that bad. The game does look very pretty in lots of locations in the game, such as Satorl Marsh and Alcamoth, but some areas like Colony 9 don't look amazing. However, if you have a 3DS XL, this may not be a problem. In April 2015, a 3DS XL port was released as an exclusive title for the system. The port comes with updated visuals for town and character models, as well as making some minor changes. If you own that port like I do, the visuals will be slightly less of a problem.</p>
            <h3>Verdict</h3>
            <p>Xenoblade Chronicles is an amazing game. It is one of my favorite games to play, and for good reason. It has one of the most interesting overworlds to explore ever crafted, its combat is fun and challenging, and the story is also a gem in a world of games with amazing stories. This is one of the best experiences on the Wii, as well as the 3DS XL. This games' problems, though they may turn some gamers away, eventually fade away as you experience this wonderful game. I rate this game 9.5 out of 10</p>
