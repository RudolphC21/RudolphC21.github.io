    <h3>Project 1- This Website!</h3>
    <div class="centered"><p>This website is my first major project, and I've enjoyed making it. I plan to constantly make changes based on things I complete and projects I take on, so there will be new content here every now and then. It wasn't a huge project or very complex project, but it's a start for what I want to do.</p></div>
    <h3>Project 2- My Blog</h3>
    <div class="centered"><p>The next project I have is my video game blog site. I really enjoy video games, so I decided recently to start a blog about video games! Right now I only have one post up about Xenoblade Chronicles, but I want to post every few weeks about the games I play and want to talk about. I wan this site to grow and change along with the main site, so keep your eyes peeled for changes!(And if you don't want to, I will probably write about my new posts here. Either/or.) There is also a link to the blog on the home page if you want to read my article about Xenoblade Chronicles!)</p></div>
